# twitter-photos-bot

## About
Tweet embeds in Discord will only preview the first photo in a embed. Furthermore, Discord is not descript when a Tweet has multiple media objects, and you must verbally tell other users that the tweet is a photo album. Thus, they have to click on the link if they want to go view the entire album. 
<br/><br/>
Twitter Photos bot will help embed photo albums in Discord so that users don't have to leave in order to view a tweet's photos.

## Usage
!tweet (Tweet URL)
